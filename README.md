Personal website with personal projects documentation (Programming, Finance etc). Objective: document and to train a little bit o front-end developing.
I will try to follow through a little HTML, CSS, Javascript developing program in order to build this project up.
Ideally, I will create a variety of Repositories with different projects through their development, documenting and displaying its outputs and so forth.
